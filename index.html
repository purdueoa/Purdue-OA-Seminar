<p>Title: On conjugate systems with respect to completely positive maps  </p>
<p>Abstract: In 2010, Dabrowski showed that a von Neumann algebra generated by self-adjoint operators is a factor when they admit a conjugate system. We extend this to the operator-valued case by defining an operator valued partial derivative and conjugate systems with respect to completely positive maps. We utilize Popa's intertwining technique and Dabrowski's argument to show that the center of the von Neumann algebra generated by B and its relative commutant is the center of B. </p>

<p>Title: Von Neumann Orbit Equivalence </p>
<p>Abstract: Recently, Peterson, Ruth, and myself introduced the notion of von Neumann equivalence which is an equivalence relation on the class of countable discrete groups, and it generalizes both measure equivalence and W\(^*\)-equivalence. Another important equivalence relation on groups that has been studied for a long time is Orbit Equivalence and it is closely related to measure equivalence. In this talk, I will introduce the notion of von Neumann orbit equivalence which is a non-commutative generalization of orbit equivalence. We will discuss the stability of this equivalence relation under taking free products and graph products. This is based on a joint work with Aoran Wu. </p>

<p>Title: Geometry and dynamics of the extension graph of graph product of groups </p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk, I will introduce the extension graph of graph product of groups and explain its geometry. This notion enables us to study the properties of graph product by exploiting the large-scale geometry of its defining graph. In particular, I show that the asymptotic dimension of the extension graph exhibits the same behavior as in the case of quasi-trees of metric spaces studied by Bestvina-Bromberg-Fujiwara. In addition, I present applications of the extension graph to the study of convergence actions, graph wreath products, and group von Neumann algebras when the defining graph is hyperbolic. </p>

<p>Title: Connes rigidity conjecture for groups with infinite center </p>
<p>Abstract: In this paper we propose for study a natural version of Connes Rigidity Conjecture (1982) which involves property (T) groups with infinite center. Using methods at the rich intersection between von Neumann algebras and geometric group theory we provide several instances when this holds.

<p>Title: S-transform in finite free probability </p>
<p>Abstract: We show a simple way to obtain the limiting spectral distribution of a sequence of polynomials (with increasing degree) directly using their coefficients. Specifically, we relate the asymptotic behavior of the ratio of consecutive coefficients to Voiculescu's S-transform of the limiting measure.</p>

<p>The intuition behind this result comes from finite free probability, that can be understood as a discrete version of free probability that has direct connections to random matrices, geometry of polynomials, representation theory and combinatorics. We will introduce finite free probability, explain some interesting applications, and mention some of the main ingredients of the proof that include topics of independent interest such as a partial order in the set of polynomials.</p>

<p>Title: A piecewise construction of classifying spaces for groups with a piecewise definition </p>
<p>Abstract:  I will describe a construction of classifying spaces for generalized Thompson groups. Here a `classifying space' is a contractible simplicial complex with `small' (in a suitable sense) stabilizers, and a `generalized Thompson group' has a piecewise definition. Examples include the groups F, T, and V defined by Richard Thompson, but there are many others. Thompson's group F is the group of piecewise linear homeomorphisms of the unit interval with the property that each slope is a power of 2, and each point of non-differentiability occurs at a dyadic rational number. </p>

<p>The construction of classifying spaces is based on a new abstract object, which we call an ``expansion set". The expansion set construction can be applied to many generalized Thompson groups, such as F, T, V, the Brin-Thompson groups nV, the Lodha-Moore group, and others. In recent work, we have shown that the expansion set construction is often a CAT(0) cubical complex, which leads to a representation of the associated generalized Thompson group in the isometry group of the Hilbert space having the cubical hyperplanes as basis. </p>

<p>A large part of this is joint work with Bruce Hughes.  </p>

<p>Title: Weak exactness and amalgamated free products </p>
<p>Abstract: Weak exactness for von Neumann algebras was first introduced by Kirchberg in 1995 as an analogue of exactness in the setting of C\(^*\)-algebras. In this talk, I will show that the amalgamated free product of weakly exact von Neumann algebras is again weakly exact. The proof involves a universal property of Toeplitz-Pimsner algebras and a locally convex topology on bimodules of von Neumann algebras, which is used to characterize weak exactness. </p>

<p>Title: Contractible Cuntz classes</p>
<p>Abstract: The Cuntz semigroup of a C\(^*\)-algebra is a sensitive invariant which can be thought of as a generalization of the Murray-von Neumann semigroup. It consists of Cuntz equivalence classes of positive elements in the stabilization of A, and these classes come in two flavors: compact (classes of projections) and non-compact (the rest). We show that if A is simple, unital and Z-stable then the set of positive elements in A belonging to a fixed non-compact Cuntz class is contractible. Combined with work of Jiang and Hua for compact classes, this completes the calculation of the homotopy groups of Cuntz classes for these algebras. </p>

<p>Title: Prime von Neumann algebras from the Thompson Groups T and V </p>
<p>Abstract: We show that the group von Neumann algebras for the Higman-Thompson groups \(T_d\) and \(V_d\) are both prime II\(_1\) factors. A II\(_1\) factor is prime if it does not decompose as a tensor product of two II\(_1\) factors. This follows from a new deformation/rigidity argument for a certain class of groups which admit a proper cocycle into a quasi-regular representation that is not necessarily weakly contained in the left-regular representation. This is joint work with Rolando de Santiago and Krishnendu Khan.  </p>

<p>Title: An index for quantum cellular automata on fusion spin chains</p>
<p>Abstract: The index for 1D quantum cellular automata (QCA) was introduced to measure the flow of the information by Gross, Nesme, Vogts, and Werner. Interpreting the index as the ratio of the Jones index for subfactors leads to a generalization of the index defined for QCA on more general abstract spin chains. These include fusion spin chains, which arise as the local operators invariant under a global (categorical/MPO) symmetry, and as the boundary operators on 2D topologically ordered spin systems. We introduce our generalization of index and show that it is a complete invariant for the group of QCA modulo finite depth circuits for the fusion spin chains built from the fusion category Fib. This talk is based on a joint work with Corey Jones. </p>

  <p>Title: Rigidity for \(W^*\)-McDuff groups </p>
  <p>Abstract: The problem of understanding how much of the group G is remembered by the group von Neumann algebra L(G) has been a major research theme in the field of operator algebras.  On one extreme of the rigidity question are \(W^*\)-superrigid groups, those which are completely recoverable from the von Neumann algebra L(G).  On the other extreme there is the class of icc amenable groups each of which generates the hyperfinite II\(_1\) factor.  In between these two extremes of superrigidity, and complete lack thereof, there are many classes of non-amenable groups that display various rigidity phenomena.  In our work, we introduce the first examples of groups whose lack of superrigidity can be completely characterized.  Specifically, we introduce the notion of, and construct, groups that are McDuff \(W^*\)-superrigid, that is groups G such that if L(G) = L(H) (for an arbitrary group H), then \(H = G \times A\) for some icc amenable group A.  We do this by introducing new geometric group theory methods to construct wreath-like product groups with a 2-cocycle with uniformly bounded support, and using the interplay between two types of deformations on their group von Neumann algebra to prove that such groups have infinite product rigidity.  This is ongoing work with Ionut Chifan, Denis Osin and Bin Sun. </p>

  <p>Title: Hilbert-Schmidt stability of amenable groups</p>
  <p>Abstract: Roughly speaking a group is Hilbert-Schmidt (HS) stable if every finite dimensional approximate unitary representation of G can be perturbed to an actual representation of G.  Here ``approximate" and ``perturbed" relate to the normalized Hilbert-Schmidt norm.  Recently HS-stability has attracted interest partially due to the connections to the Connes embedding problem for groups. For amenable groups Hadwin and Shulman reformulated HS-stability in terms of tracial approximations. This reformulation makes available the tools of operator algebras to be applied to HS-stability problems for amenable groups.  I will give a gentle introduction to this topic and discuss recent joint work with T. Shulman showing that nilpotent groups are HS-stable, constructing the first examples of amenable HS-stable non-permutation stable groups, and whatever else time allows. </p>

    <p>Title: Local K-theory markers for matrix models of quantum materials  </p>
    <p>Abstract: We will show how basic K-theory shows up in the analysis of quantum dots and nanowires.  Physical systems in 2D and 3D need a more
sophisticated approach, inspired by E-theory. A local theory of
electron structure leads to a forms of joint spectrum for noncommuting
Hermitian operators.  This spectrum can break position-energy space
into regions that have K-theory labels that can predict stability
against disorder and defect. These labels are numerically computable,
and provide local K-theory formulas in any dimensions and in any
of the symmetry classes in what physicists call the ten-fold way.</p>

spectral measure, a tracial joint spectral measure on the plane.
Existence of this measure implies that any two-dimensional subspace of
the Schatten-p class is isometric to a subspace of \(L_p\). We discuss
some applications and limitations of this result.

      <p>Title: On the structure of graph product von Neumann algebras</p>
      <p>Abstract: We undertake a systematic study of structural properties of graph products of von Neumann algebras equipped with faithful, normal states, as well as properties of the graph products relative to subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs. Under mild assumptions on unitaries in the centralizers of the algebras attached to each vertex, we give a complete classification of when two subalgebras coming from induced subgraphs can be amenable relative to each other. We also give a complete description of when the graph product can be full, diffuse, or a factor. Our results are new even in the tracial setting. They also allow us to deduce new results about when graph products of groups can be amenable relative to each other. This is work done jointly with Ian Charlesworth, Ben Hayes, David Jekel, Srivatsav Kunnawalkam Elayavalli, and Brent Nelson </p>

      <p>Abstract: We will take a look at entropic inequalities developed for quantum Markov semigroups on von Neumann algebra and the tools developed for obtaining said inequalities. Marius Junge and others developed the complete modified log Sobolev inequality (CLSI) for von Neumann algebras. This particular inequality has many desirable characteristics, mainly the feature of tensor stability, something that previous spectral gap inequalities fail. The main focus of the talk will be to examine a tool in obtaining this inequality called the "transference principle" and its different applications to studying quantum Markov semigroups on compact manifolds and compact Lie groups. Time permitting, we will also touch on the compact Lie groupoid case and its development.  </p>

      <p>Title: Nuclear Dimension of \(C^*\)-Algebras and Extensions </p>
      <p>Abstract: Nuclear dimension has been an important tool used in the classification of simple \(C^*\)-algebras. When \(A\) is an extension of a \(C^*\)-algebra \(B\) by an ideal \(I\), the nuclear dimension of \(B\) and \(I\) provide an upper bound on the nuclear dimension of \(A\). However, this upper bound is usually very far from being tight. A series of results over the last several years have improved the upper bound in many important cases. In this talk, I will provide background on nuclear dimension and cover some of the important results on extensions. I will also discuss my work with Christopher Schafhauser on the nuclear dimension of graph \(C^*\)-algebras, which are an excellent source of examples of extensions. </p>

We use a combination of the following two new ideas to obtain lower bounds on the Fuglede Kadison determinant of matrix polynomials in a generating set: a notion called 'algebraic soficity' for *-algebras allowing for the existence of Galois bounded microstates with asymptotically constant diagonals; a new probabilistic construction of permutation models for graph independence over the diagonal. </p>

    <p>Title:  An operator algebraic axiomatization of local topological orders</p>
    <p>Abstract: Topological order is a notion in theoretical condensed matter physics describing new phases of matter beyond Landau's symmetry breaking paradigm. Bravyi, Hastings, and Michalakis introduced certain topological quantum order (TQO) axioms to ensure gap stability of a commuting projector local Hamiltonian and stabilize the ground state space with respect to local operators in a quantum spin system.</p>
    <p>
    In joint work with Corey Jones, Pieter Naaijkens, and Daniel Wallick (<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/2307.12552">arXiv:2307.12552</a>), we study nets of finite dimensional C*-algebras on a \(\mathbb{Z}^{k}\) lattice equipped with a net of projections as an abstract version of a quantum spin system equipped with a local Hamiltonian. We introduce a set of local topological order (LTO) axioms which imply the TQO conditions of Bravyi-Hastings-Michalakis in the frustration free commuting projector setting, and we show our LTO axioms are satisfied by known 2D examples, including Kitaev's toric code and Levin-Wen string net models associated to unitary fusion categories (UFCs).</p>
    <p>
    From the LTO axioms, we can produce a canonical net of algebras on a codimension 1 sublattice \(\mathbb{Z}^{k-1}\) which we call the net of boundary algebras. We get a canonical state on the boundary net of algebras, and we calculate this canonical state for both the toric code and Levin-Wen string net models. Surprisingly, for the Levin-Wen model, this state is a trace on the boundary net exactly when the UFC is pointed, i.e., all quantum dimensions are equal to 1. Moreover, the boundary net of algebras for Levin-Wen are bounded-spread isomorphic to nets of algebras arising directly from the UFC; for these latter nets, Corey Jones' category of DHR bimodules recovers the Drinfeld center, leading to a bulk-boundary correspondence where the bulk topological order is described by representations of the boundary net.</p>

    <p>Title: Entropy-Producing Quantum Dynamics in von Neumann Algebras</p>
    <p>Abstract: Finite-dimensional information or complexity theoretic analogies could explain phenomena usually modeled via quantum field theories in von Neumann algebras of type II or III. Hence a broad question is how quantum dynamics depend on their underlying operator algebra. Araki's definition of quantum relative entropy via the relative modular operator suggests that this notion of information and corresponding non-invertibility applies widely across von Neumann algebras. I will discuss recent results that hold across types, conjectures on what other phenomena might, and techniques that transfer estimates across types. Particular emphasis is on dynamics modeled by quantum Markov semigroups, channels, and interactions between subalgebras.

In this talk, I will give a bit of history and survey a few of these results in the case of tracial von Neumann algebras.

    <p>Title: on Neumann Algebras of Thompson-like Groups</p>
    <p>Abstract: In this talk, I will discuss some results concerning the von Neumann algebras of Thompson-like groups arising from \(d\)-ary cloning systems (for \(d \ge 2\)). This talk will essentially be a survey of results coming from three papers I have written so far on this topic, the first two of which I wrote with Matthew Zaremsky, who invented cloning systems with Stefan Witzel in 2018.
     
    Given a \(d\)-ary cloning system on a sequence \((G_n)_{n \in \mathbb{N}}\) of groups, we can form a Thompson-like group denoted by \(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)\), and this group canonically contains \(F_d\), the smallest of the Higman-Thompson groups. The group inclusion \(F_d \le \mathscr{T}_d(G_*)\) translates to an inclusion of their group von Neumann algebras \(L(F_d) \subseteq L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))\). Concerning this inclusion, I was able to prove it satisfies the weak asymptotic homomorphisms property (WAHP), which is equivalent to \(L(F_d)\) being a weakly mixing subfactor of \(L(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*))\). That the inclusion satisfies the WAHP will have a number of consequences which I will discuss. Another main result is that many of these Thompson-like groups yield McDuff factors, a considerable generalization of Jolissaint's result that \(L(F)\) is a McDuff factor, where \(F = F_2\) is one of the "classical" Thompson's groups.
     
    Using cloning systems, I constructed a machine which takes in any group and produces a Thompson-like group yielding a McDuff factor. Modifying this construction, I was also able to construct another machine which takes in any finite group and any other group and produces an infinite index singular inclusion of \(II_1\) factors without the WAHP, the first examples of their kind. Using cloning systems and character rigidity, I was also able to prove the Higman-Thompson groups \(F_d\) are McDuff (in the sense of Vaes-Deprez) and that, in some cases, a certain canonical subgroup of \(\mathscr{T}_d(G_*)\) yields a Cartan subalgebra in these Thompson-like group factors.  If time permits, I will also mention some preliminary results on the \(C^*\)-algebra side of Thompson-like groups arising from cloning systems.</p>

    <p>Title:  Hilbert-Schmidt stability versus Connes Embeddability of groups</p>
    <p>Abstract:  In his seminal paper from 1976, A. Connes singled out an important approximation property for tracial von Neumann algebras, and asked whether all separable II1 factors satisfy it. Consequently, F. Radulescu asked the question of whether all group von Neumann algebras are Connes embeddable. This question became of major interest to group theory, through its connection with the notion of sofic groups.
    
     On the other side of the story, several new robustness properties of groups, colloquially referred to as stability, have gathered considerable attention in recent years. Among them is Flexible Hilbert Schmidt stability: A group G is flexibly HS-stable if any approximate finite dimensional unitary representation of G is close to a compression of a genuine representation of slightly larger dimension. In this talk, we will give conditional statements of the form "If G is flexibly HS-stable, then there exists a non Connes embeddable group". This statement is shown to hold for many property (T) groups, including Gromov random groups, and lattices in non-simply connected simple Lie groups. Time permitting, we will comment on the operator-algebraic proof.</p>

<p> Title: An algebraic quantum field theoretic approach to toric code with gapped boundary </p>
<p> Abstract: Topologically ordered quantum spin systems have become an area of great interest, as they may provide a fault-tolerant means of quantum computation.  One of the simplest examples of such a spin system is Kitaev's toric code.  Naaijkens made mathematically rigorous the treatment of toric code on an infinite planar lattice (the thermodynamic limit), using an operator algebraic approach via algebraic quantum field theory.  We adapt his methods to study the case of toric code with gapped boundary.  In particular, we recover the condensation results described in Kitaev and Kong and show that the boundary theory is a module tensor category over the bulk, as expected.</p>

<p>Title: Analytic Vectors for Derivations on C\(^*\)-algebras</p>
<p>Abstract: Given a (possibly unbounded) symmetric operator D on a Hilbert space \(H\), Nelson’s Analytic Vector Theorem states that \(D\) is in fact (essentially) self-adjoint (which is a stronger condition than being symmetric when \(D\) is unbounded) if and only if \(D\) has a dense set of analytic vectors in \(H\). In this talk, we will review the difference between symmetric and self-adjoint unbounded operators on Hilbert space, and we will discuss the definition of an analytic vector for such an operator. Then, we will consider the definition of an analytic vector for a derivation on C\(^*\)-algebra which arises via commutation with a self-adjoint operator on a Hilbert space. We will finish by showing that assuming our derivation is weak operator topology continuous, there is a weak operator topology dense set of analytic vectors for that derivation, which is an analogous theorem to Nelson’s but in the case of derivations on C\(^*\)-algebras.</p>

<p>Title: C\(^*\)-Algebraic Mackey Analogy of Reductive Groups</p>
<p>Abstract: In the 1970's, George Mackey proposed an analogy between some unitary representations of a semisimple Lie group and unitary representations of its associated semidirect product group, known as the Cartan motion group. Recently, Nigel Higson and Alexandre Afgoustidis made this analogy precise between equivalence classes of irreducible tempered representations of a reductive groups and equivalence classes of irreducible unitary representations of the associated Cartan group. First, I will introduce tempered unitary representations of a reductive Lie group to develop the Mackey analogy. The goal of this talk is to show that the reduced group C\(^*\)-algebra of the Cartan motion group can be embedded into the reduced group C\(^*\)-algebra of the reductive group. To accomplish this, I will show the construction of a continuous fields of C\(^*\)-algebras generated from a Lie groupoid known as deformation to the normal cone. I will also discuss the Fourier transform picture.

<p>Title: Free Stein dimension of crossed products by finite group </p>
<p>Abstract: In this talk, we will discuss a free probabilistic quantity called free Stein dimension and compute it for a crossed product by a finite group. The free Stein dimension is the Murray-von Neumann dimension of a particular subspace of derivations. Charlesworth and Nelson defined this quantity in the hope of finding a von Neumann algebra invariant. While it is still not known to be a von Neumann algebra invariant, it is an invariant for finitely generated unital tracial *-algebras and algebraic methods have been more successful than analytic ones in studying it. Our result continuous this trend and reveals a formula for the free Stein dimension of a crossed product by a finite group that is reminiscent of the Schreier formula for a finite index subgroup of free groups.  </p>

<p>Title: When do reduced group C\(^∗\)-algebras of amenable groups not have real rank zero? </p>
<p>Abstract: For every torsion free, discrete and amenable group \(G\), the Kadison-Kaplansky
conjecture has been verified, so C\(^∗
_r (G)\) has no nontrivial projections. On the other hand, every
torsion element \(g \in G\), of order \(n\), gives rise to a projection \( \frac{1+g+\cdots +g^{n-1}}{n} \in C^∗_r (G)\). Actually, if
\(G\) is locally finite, then \(C^∗_r (G)\) is an AF-algebra, so it has an abundance of projections. So, it
natural to ask what happens on the intermediate cases. In 2017, Scarparo proved that for every
discrete, infinite, finitely generated elementary amenable group \(G\), \(C^∗_r (G)\) cannot have real rank
zero. Roughly speaking, having real rank zero is a weaker property than being an AF-algebra and is
characterized by having many projections. In this talk, we will prove that if \(G\) is discrete, amenable
and has a normal subgroup that is not locally finite but is elementary amenable with finite Hirsch
length, then \(C^∗_r (G)\) does not have real rank zero. </p>

<p>Abstract: I will discuss recent joint work with Hayes wherein we show that any sofic group G that is initially sub-amenable (a limit of amenable groups in Grigorchuk's space of marked groups) admits two embeddings into the universal sofic group S that are not conjugate by any automorphism of S. Time permintting, I will also characterise precisely when two almost homomorphisms of an amenable group G are conjugate, in terms of certain IRS's associated to the two actions of G. One of the applications of this is to recover the result of Becker-Lubotzky-Thom around permutation stability for amenable groups.

<p>Title: Ergodic Quantum Processes in Finite von Neumann algebras</p>
<p>Abstract: In 1997, H. Hennion used a non-standard metric to show a kind of multiplicative ergodic theorem for the convergence of an infinite product of positive random matrices. Recently Movassagh and Schenker proved a quantum-channel version of Hennion's ergodic theorem. We will discuss the necessary background to understand the generalization of Hennion's metric to the state space of a tracial von Neumann algebra $(M,\tau)$, and a characterization of contraction mappings in this metric. We will discuss generalizations of the theorems of Movassagh and Schenker to everywhere-defined, positive maps on the noncommutative $L^1$ space. Time permitting, we will sketch the proof of our characterization of contraction mappings and discuss its applications to locally normal states on the spin chain.

<p>Title: On the classification of modular categories</p>
<p>Abstract: Modular categories are intricate organizing algebraic structures appearing in a variety of mathematical subjects including topological quantum field theory, conformal field theory, representation theory of quantum groups, von Neumann algebras, and vertex operator algebras. They are fusion categories with additional braiding and pivotal structures satisfying a non-degeneracy condition. The problem of classifying modular categories is motivated by applications to topological quantum computation as algebraic models for topological phases of matter.
In this talk, we will start by introducing some of the basic definitions and properties of fusion, braided, and modular categories, and we will also give some concrete examples to have a better understanding of their structures. I will give an overview of the current situation of the classification program for modular categories and mention some open directions to explore. </p>

<p>Title: Quantum Non-Local Games </p>
<p>Abstract:  In recent years, nonlocal games have received significant attention in operator algebras and resulted in highly fruitful interactions, including the recent resolution of the Connes Embedding Problem. A nonlocal game involves two non-communicating players (Alice and Bob) who cooperatively play to win against a referee. In this talk, I will provide an introduction to the theory of non-local games and quantum correlation classes. We will discuss the role of C\(^*\)-algebras and operator systems in the study of their perfect strategies and observe that mathematical structures arising from entanglement-assisted strategies for nonlocal games can be naturally interpreted and studied using tools from operator algebras and quantum groups. An alternate formulation of quantum correlations in terms of quantum channels will be presented. This will be used to introduce a more general framework of non local games involving quantum inputs and quantum outputs. </p>

<p> Title: Extensions of quasidiagonal \(C^*\)-algebras. </p>
<p> Abstract: It is known that a quasidiagonal \(C^*\)-algebra is stably finite. While the converse is not true (one counterexample is \(C_r(\mathbb{F}_2))\), Blackadar and Kirchberg conjectured that it holds for separable and nuclear \(C^*\)-algebras. In my talk, I will examine the validity of this conjecture for \(C^*\)-algebras that arise as extensions of separable, nuclear and quasidiagonal \(C^*\)-algebras that satisfy the UCT. By the work of Brown and Dadarlat, this problem is equivalent to proving a K-theoretic embedding property, called \(K_0\)-embedding property. Using this approach, I will solve the problem in the case that the ideal is locally approximated by algebras in a class that contains all approximately subhomogeneous algebras, as well as certain crossed products by the integers. </p>

<p> Abstract:  A discrete group is matricially stable if every function from the group to a complex unitary group that is ``almost multiplicative'' in the point-operator norm topology is ``close'' to a genuine unitary representation in the point-operator norm topology. It follows from a recent result due to Dadarlat shows that all polycyclic groups with non-torsion integral 2-cohomology are not matricially stable, but the proof does not lead to explicit examples of asymptotic representations that are not perturbable to genuine representations. In this talk I will construct explicit examples of asymptotic representations that are not perturbable to genuine representations for a class of groups that contains all finitely generated groups with a non-torsion 2-cohomology class that corresponds to a central extension where the middle group is residually finite. </p>

In this talk, I will review the different perspectives to quantum graphs and introduce a chromatic number for quantum graphs using a non-local game with quantum inputs and classical outputs. I will then show that many spectral lower bounds for chromatic numbers in the classical case (such as Hoffman’s bound) also hold in the setting of quantum graphs. This is achieved using an algebraic formulation of quantum graph coloring and tools from linear algebra.</p>

   <p>Title: Relative Toeplitz graph algebras: subgraphs, ideals, quotients, and pullbacks </p>
   <p>Abstract: Abstract: Part of the appeal of graph \(C^*\)-algebras is that we can get information about them by looking at the structure of their underlying directed graphs. For instance, the quotient of \(C^*(E)\) by a gauge-invariant ideal is naturally isomorphic to the graph algebra of a certain subgraph of \(E\) – well, sometimes; if \(E\) is row-finite then this is always the case. Otherwise, the quotient \(C^*\)-algebra may be realized as the algebra of a graph that can be built from \(E\), according to data encoded in the ideal (Bates, et al. 2002), and, for certain ideals, the result will in fact be a subgraph of \(E\). We can elide some of this fussiness if we look instead at the relative Toeplitz algebra
   \(\mathcal{T}C^*(E,A)\) given by some set
   \(A \subseteq \text{reg}(E)\). We choose to take this approach, and introduce a corresponding category of relative directed graphs. We describe our algebras using groupoids built from the paths in the graph. In our main result, we characterize when the commuting square of relative Toeplitz algebras given by a pushout diagram of relative graphs is, in fact, a pullback diagram of \(C^*\)-algebras, generalizing results of Hajac et al. (2020). This is joint work with Jack Spielber</p>

   <p>Title: The Weyl construction for dynamical Cartan subalgebras</p>
   <p>Abstract: uilding on earlier work of Kumjian, Renault proved in 2008 that a C*-algebra \(A\) has a Cartan subalgebra \(B\) iff \(A\) is the C*-algebra of a twist over a topologically principal groupoid \(W\) (the Weyl groupoid of the Cartan pair \((B, A))\).  However, one can build C*-algebras out of much more general groupoids.  Do those have Cartan subalgebras, and if so, what is the relationship between the Weyl groupoid and the original groupoid? In joint work with A. Duwenig, R. Norton, S. Reznikoff, and S. Wright, we identified situations when a subgroupoid S of a non-principal groupoid G will give rise to a Cartan subalgebra \(B = C*(S)\) of \(A = C*(G)\).  Subsequent work, joint with A. Duwenig and R. Norton, revealed that the Weyl groupoid \(W\) of the pair \((B, A)\) is a semidirect product: \(W = G/S \ltimes \widehat{S}\).  We also describe the Weyl twist explicitly in the situation where there is a continuous section \(G/S \to G\). If you're still mostly lost after reading this abstract, never fear! The talk will not assume familiarity with groupoids, their C*-algebras, or Cartan subalgebras for C*-algebras, and should (I hope) be more comprehensible.

<p>Title: On Connes Rigidity Conjecture</p>
<p>Abstract:  In this talk I will introduce a new class of groups, which we call <em>wreath-like products</em>. These groups are close relatives of the classical wreath products and arise naturally in the context of group theoretic Dehn filling. Unlike ordinary wreath products, many wreath-like products have strong fixed point properties including Kazhdan's property (T). In this paper, we establish several new rigidity results for von Neumann algebras of wreath-like products. In particular, we obtain the first continuum of property (T) groups whose von Neumann algebras satisfy Connes' rigidity conjecture and the first examples of W\(^*\)-superrigid groups with property (T). We also compute automorphism groups of von Neumann algebras of a wide class of wreath-like products; as an application, we show that for every finitely presented group \(Q\), there exists a property (T) group \(G\) such that \(Out(L(G))\cong Q\).
This is based on new joint work with Adrian Ioana, Denis Osin and Bin Sun.</p>
